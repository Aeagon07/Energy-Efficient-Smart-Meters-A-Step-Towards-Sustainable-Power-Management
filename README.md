# Energy-Efficient-Smart-Meters-A-Step-Towards-Sustainable-Power-Management
The improvements in billing accuracy, the efficiency of data gathering and the savings in costs were especially impactful.

It is well-known that current energy management systems suffer from significant inefficiencies due to outdated metering technologies, which fail to provide live data. This results in higher costs, energy wastage, and additional stress on the power grid. Traditional methods, heavily reliant on manual data collection, are prone to human errors, delays, and inaccurate billing. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Smart Meter system.
The system transforms the way of energy consumption and management across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. By integrating advanced metering infrastructure with IoT technology and the immediate analysis of real-time data, the system will optimize its way toward energy efficiency and cost saving while also encouraging green initiatives. Incorporating current and voltage sensors with a LoRa-based communication network allows for precise monitoring and immediate reporting, eliminating the need for on-site personnel for meter readings and significantly reducing errors in the billing process. The key objective of this program is to make billing more accurate and operations more efficient by automating it and keeping an eye on live data. The Smart Meter system represents a revolutionary leap in energy management technology. By using real-time data and sophisticated analytics, it can potentially change the face of energy usage into one that is more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable for a better future.

II. LITERATUTRE REVIEW
Gunawan Wibisono et al. conducted a techno-economic analysis to assess the implementation of LoRa-based smart meters in PLN Bali. The study emphasizes the transition from traditional manual meters to smart meters that enable real-time, two-way communication, supporting Bali's Eco Smart Grid initiative. LoRa WAN is highlighted for its long-range, low-power, and cost-effective features, making it more suitable than alternatives like SigFox or NB-IoT.The analysis evaluates three business models—Build Own, Build Operate Transfer (BOT), and leasing—concluding that leasing and BOT reduce financial strain but face challenges like high initial investment and long payback periods. Regulatory compliance with the 923-925 MHz frequency band favors LoRa deployment, though interference and lack of duty cycle regulations pose risks.
Overall, the study demonstrates LoRa's potential to enable scalable and energy-efficient smart metering
